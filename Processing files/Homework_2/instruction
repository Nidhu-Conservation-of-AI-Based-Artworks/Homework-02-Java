Yoko Ono Instruction:

PIECE FOR THREE CHIMNIES


Build three chimnies.

Build them so that from a certain distant point they look like one chimney, from another point:
like two and from another point: like three.

Take pictures of the three different images.

You may build houses, temples, etc., instead of chimnies.
